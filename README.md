HTML5 Game Development Series
=============================

This repo contains files from my [HTML5 Game Development series on Youtube.](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL290A4D2398C97186&feature=plcp)

The files shown above are from the finished game. However, the **downloads** folder contains the zipped files for each tutorial.

If you want to test out the game, [click here.](http://gyrostorm.github.com/html5-game-dev-series/)

Some tutorials are missing, but most of them are there. Each zip file only includes the files that were updated in that tutorial.
