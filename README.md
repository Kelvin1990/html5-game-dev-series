HTML5 Game Development Series
=============================

This repo contains files from my [HTML5 Game Development series on Youtube.](http://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL290A4D2398C97186&feature=plcp)

The files shown above are from the finished game. Zipped tutorial files can be [downloaded here](https://github.com/gyrostorm/html5-game-dev-series/downloads)

Some tutorials are missing, but most of them are there. Each zip file only includes the files that were updated in that tutorial.
